            <h6 className="h6 text-black">
              Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be
              economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides
              and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to
              rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite
              (Fe3O4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe2O3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH),
              62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H2O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO3,
              48.2% Fe).

            <h5 className="h4 text-black">BLACK SAND</h5>
            <h6 className="h6 text-black">
              Black sand is sand that is black in color. One type of black sand
              is a heavy, glossy, partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands
              containing minerals such as magnetite, found as part of a placer
              deposit. Another type of black sand, found on beaches near a
              volcano, consists of tiny fragments of basalt.
              <br></br>
              While some beaches are predominantly made of black sand, even
              other color beaches (e.g. gold and white) can often have deposits
              of black sand, particularly after storms. Larger waves can sort
              out sand grains leaving deposits of heavy minerals visible on the
              surface of erosion escarpments.

            <h5 className="h4 text-black">SILICA</h5>
            <h6 className="h6 text-black">
              Also called silicon dioxide, compound of the two most abundant
              elements in Earth’s crust, silicon and oxygen, SiO2. The mass of
              Earth’s crust is 59 percent silica, the main constituent of more
              than 95 percent of the known rocks. Silica has three main
              crystalline varieties: quartz (by far the most abundant),
              tridymite, and cristobalite. Other varieties include coesite,
              keatite, and lechatelierite. Silica sand is used in buildings and
              roads in the form of portland cement, concrete, and mortar, as
              well as sandstone. Silica also is used in grinding and polishing
              glass and stone; in foundry molds; in the manufacture of glass,
              ceramics, silicon carbide, ferrosilicon, and silicones; as a
              refractory material; and as gemstones. Silica gel is often used as
              a desiccant to remove moisture.

            <h5 className="h4 text-black">SILVER</h5>
            <h6 className="h6 text-black">
              Silver is a chemical element with the symbol Ag (from Latin
              argentum 'silver', derived from the Proto-Indo-European h₂erǵ
              'shiny, white') and atomic number 47. A soft, white, lustrous
              transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity,
              thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal.[6] The metal
              is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form
              ("native silver"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in
              minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is
              produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.
              <br></br>
              Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. Silver metal is
              used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold:[7] while it
              is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native
              metal.[8] Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a
              94%-pure alloy is described as "0.940 fine". As one of the seven
              metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human
              cultures.
              <br></br>
              Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and
              bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration,
              jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the
              term "silverware"), in electrical contacts and conductors, in
              specialized mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical
              reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialized
              confectionery. Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray
              film. Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver
              compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides
              (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings,
              catheters, and other medical instruments.

            <h5 className="h4 text-black">GOLD</h5>
            <h6 className="h6 text-black">
              Is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin aurum 'gold')
              and atomic number 79. It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow,
              dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in pure form.
              Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It
              is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under
              standard conditions.
              <br></br>
              Gold often occurs in free elemental (native state), as nuggets or
              grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. It occurs in a
              solid solution series with the native element silver (as in
              electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and
              palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less
              commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with
              tellurium (gold tellurides).

            <h5 className="h4 text-black">COPPER</h5>
            <h6 className="h6 text-black">
              Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin:
              cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile
              metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A
              freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color.
              Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a
              building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys,
              such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make
              marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges
              and thermocouples for temperature measurement.
              <br></br>
              Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a
              directly usable metallic form (native metals). This led to very
              early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of
              years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide
              ores, c. 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a
              mold, c. 4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with
              another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.[6]
